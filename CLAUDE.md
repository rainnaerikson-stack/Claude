# Project Rules

## Accessibility — WCAG 2.1 AA Color Contrast (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All generated documents (PDFs, reports, HTML) MUST meet WCAG 2.1 AA minimum contrast ratios **before** writing or running any code. Do not produce a first draft and fix it after feedback.

### Rules

- **Normal text (< 18pt regular, < 14pt bold):** minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio against its background.
- **Large text (≥ 18pt regular or ≥ 14pt bold):** minimum 3:1 contrast ratio against its background.
- **UI components / decorative elements:** 3:1 minimum.

### ReportLab-specific enforcement

- **Never put a `Paragraph` with a colored `textColor` style inside a table cell that relies on `TEXTCOLOR` in `TableStyle` to set the color.** `TableStyle TEXTCOLOR` only affects plain strings — it does NOT override a `Paragraph`'s own `textColor`. Always use a dedicated paragraph style with the correct `textColor` for table header and body cells.
- All table cells must be `Paragraph` objects (not plain strings) so text wraps and styles apply correctly.
- Define a `table_header_style` (white text) and `table_cell_style` (dark text) and use them consistently.

### Pre-approved palette (verified contrast ratios on white background)

| BRAND_BLUE    | #1E3A8A   | ~13:1             | All text sizes   |
| DARK_TEAL     | #0369A1   | ~7.2:1            | All text sizes   |
| LUNA_PURPLE   | #6D28D9   | ~7.6:1            | All text sizes   |

| ACCENT_GREEN  | #065F46   | ~10.8:1           | All text sizes   |
| SLATE_600     | #475569   | ~7.2:1            | All text sizes   |
| BRAND_TEAL    | #0EA5E9   | ~3.3:1            | Decorative / backgrounds ONLY — never for body text |

### Checklist before generating any PDF

- [ ] Every text color + background combination has been verified against the ratios above
- [ ] No `Paragraph` object relies on a `TableStyle TEXTCOLOR` command to be readable
- [ ] All table cells use `Paragraph` objects, not plain strings
